# Heart-Disease-Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health metrics. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and two classification models (Random Forest and SVM) with hyperparameter tuning. The goal is to demonstrate how ML can assist in early detection of cardiovascular conditions.
## Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Random Forest and SVM classification models
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Feature importance analysis

## Dataset
The dataset contains various health metrics including:
- Age
- Gender
- Smoking status
- Cholesterol levels
- Blood pressure
- And other relevant health indicators

## Results
- Random Forest Accuracy: 100%
- SVM Accuracy: 100%

## Requirements
- Python 3.13.2
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the script: `python heart_disease_prediction.py`
