# Heart-Disease-Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health metrics. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and two classification models (Random Forest and SVM) with hyperparameter tuning. The goal is to demonstrate how ML can assist in early detection of cardiovascular conditions.
